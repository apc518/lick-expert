# The Lick Expert

An expert system AI that tries to determine if an input audio file is an example of the jazz meme "The Lick".

The very important step of *melody extraction* is done through work by Justin Salamon. `audio_to_midi_melodia.py` is a fork of [their script](https://github.com/justinsalamon/audio_to_midi_melodia).

All other scripts are written by me.
